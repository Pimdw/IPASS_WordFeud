A Wordfeud solver

You can choose between a greedy algorithm and a random algorithm.

Give yourself an edge with this wordfeud solver.

Tutorial:
Begin by running the main.py, make sure the algorithm.make_and_save_DAWG_reversed_DAWG() is selected for the first time.

(1) If you want the solver to help you against another player and you are the starting player, type in 1, 1, 1 and select the type of algorithm after each prompt.

(2) If you want the solver to help you against another player and you are not the starting player, type in 1, 2, 1 and select the type of algorithm after each prompt. 

You can also play other game configurations in here, just follow what the prompt says and you can also play versus the computer.
